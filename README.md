## Project Overview
Customer attrition, often referred to as customer churn or turnover, is a critical concern for businesses as it represents the percentage of customers who have stopped using their products or services within a specific timeframe. Accurately identifying why and when customers leave can significantly impact an organization's strategy for customer retention.


## Project objective
In this project, we aim to predict customer churn and understand the key indicators of churn by analyzing a dataset containing various customer attributes. By employing machine learning techniques, we'll determine the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization and explore effective retention strategies to mitigate this challenge.

## Goals

Predict customer churn based on the provided attributes.

Identify key indicators that significantly influence customer churn.

Formulate effective strategies for customer retention based on the analysis.

## Usage

Clone the repository.

Install the necessary libraries listed in the requirements file.

Run the provided scripts to preprocess the data and perform the machine-learning tasks.

Examine the results and analyses in the notebook or scripts.
